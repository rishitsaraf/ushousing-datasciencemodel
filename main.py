Saying that the housing market is influenced by a myriad of factors could be an understatement. 
The entire process of reverse engineering something as complex and as complicated as a housing market requires in-depth and 
unbiased analysis which in turn produces credible predictive analytics.

The **S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index** measures the change in the value of the U.S. 
residential housing market by tracking the purchase prices of single-family homes, which I have used as a proxy for home prices.

As of October 2021, there were 208.4 million single-family dwelling units in the United States and only 37.8 million multifamily units. 
**The size of single-family housing units has steadily risen since the start of the 21st century.**

There is an¬†upward trend in the average size¬†of floor area in new single-family homes. In 1975, a new home had an average floor area of about 1,660 square feet.
By 2019, this figure had **increased by** about 900 square feet.

\nPopulation decline might lead to a decrease in housing demand. This will, however, only happen in the long run, after not only the number of people but also the number of households has started to decline. The danger of population decline is greatest in remote rural areas and in areas with lower-quality housing.
At the same time, the supply of housing influences the opportunities for population increase through migration.

Lower consumer spending reduces business revenue, which forces companies to cut more payroll. This downward cycle can be devastating to individuals and the economy.
When unemployment is rising, fewer people will be able to afford a house. But, even the fear of unemployment may discourage people from entering the property market.
An increase in jobs, employees and wages consequently results in an increase in income for all workers in a country. With that, an increase in income also increases the demand for affordable housing.
\nDuring the Great Recession, unemployment reached 10% in October 2009. 
In 2020, it reached double digits again at 14.7% in April when the U.S. was dealing with a pandemic and recession.
The US unemployment rate edged down to 3.8 percent in February of 2022 from 4 percent in the previous month, a new pandemic low and below market expectations of 3.9 percent. The number of unemployed persons edged down by 243 thousand to 6.270 million.

The shortfall in household income is attributable in part to two recessions since 2000. The first recession, lasting from March 2001 to November 2001, was relatively short-lived.7 Yet household incomes were slow to recover from the 2001 recession and it was not until 2007 that the median income was restored to about its level in 2000.

\nBut 2007 also marked the onset of the Great Recession, and that delivered another blow to household incomes. This time it took until 2015 for incomes to approach their pre-recession level. Indeed, the median household income in 2015 ‚Äì $70,200 ‚Äì was no higher than its level in 2000, marking a 15-year period of stagnation, an episode of unprecedented duration in the past five decades.8

\nMore recent trends in household income suggest that the effects of the Great Recession may finally be in the past. From 2015 to 2018, the median U.S. household income increased from 70,200 to 74,600 dollars, at an annual average rate of 2.1%.

A clear difference between these two episodes is the level of mortgage rates: Rates were much higher in the Great Recession. As mortgage rates go up, the ratio goes down and vice versa.

many would-be homeowners might choose to build their own home rather than purchase one that someone else built.

This coupled with the increased number of people descending on the market caused prices to soar; it seemed like an easy way to make cash fast.

Despite a deep recession, the U.S. housing market in 2020 set a record for the fewest foreclosures ever.

Just 214,323 properties were in some stage of foreclosure last year, well below the previous low set in 2019, according to ATTOM Data Solutions. Properties with foreclosure filings in 2020 represented a scant 0.16 percent of all U.S. homes, down from a foreclosure rate of 0.36 percent in 2019. The record high was 2.23 percent, in 2010.

In a separate study released Friday, mortgage data firm Black Knight said foreclosure starts plunged by 67 percent from 2019, while foreclosure sales dropped by 70 percent compared to the previous year.

However, the data isn‚Äôt all rosy. Fully 2.15 million American homeowners were 90 days past due on their mortgages, a number that rose by 1.7 million during the year of the coronavirus pandemic, Black Knight said.

Foreclosures fell not because all was well economically, but because lenders essentially stopped taking back properties in 2020. After the coronavirus pandemic struck in March, federal and state officials hit the pause button on default filings by lenders. And the CARES Act called for mortgage forbearance plans designed to keep struggling workers in their homes.

st.header("Conclusion")
st.write('''
It is known that for a regression model the R-Squared value always increases and never decres incase the number of variables are increased.
To make up for this, the Adjusted R-Squared penalises the R-Squared based on the number of variables. A very low Adjusted R-Square may indicate that some
of the variables are not contributing. And as we take more variables the R-Squared value rises, which is represented in the above cases. 
However, in the case 1, the Adjusted R-Squared value is very low, indicating that there is no variable that is not contributing at all. 
\n The probablistic F-Static value for case 3 is lesser than that of case 1, indicating that the most correlated field, "Population", 
does have great influence on the index. This also allows us to conclude, that the results of the correlation analysis are true and are proven here.
Thus, we can say that the most import factors in order influencing the *S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index* are the most 
correlated factors. And that Multiple regression analysis is only useful in quantifying relationships in factors when there is a need to do predective
modelling and not singling out one most important variable out of multiple variables.
